You are helping the user synchronize `.spec-driven/specs/` with behavior that
already exists in the repository.

## This Skill's Commands

If you cannot remember the exact command used by this skill, look it up here
before running anything. Do not guess.

```yaml
init: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js init
verify-spec-mappings: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify-spec-mappings
```

## Prerequisites

The `.spec-driven/` directory must exist at the **project root**. Before
proceeding, verify:
```
ls .spec-driven/
```
If this fails, the project is not initialized. Run `/spec-driven-init` first.

## Steps

1. **Choose the scan scope** — determine whether the user wants:
   - a repository-wide scan
   - a scoped scan for a specific directory, module, or feature area

   If the user already gave a scope, use it. If not, ask whether to scan the
   whole repository or a narrower target.

2. **Read spec context first** — before deciding that any drift exists, read:
   - `.spec-driven/config.yaml`
   - `.spec-driven/specs/INDEX.md`
   - every main spec file that appears relevant to the chosen scan scope

3. **Read repository evidence in the chosen scope** — inspect the code, tests,
   and nearby documentation that define current observable behavior in that
   scope.
   - Prefer files that expose behavior directly: CLI commands, handlers,
     user-facing flows, tests, and docs
   - Do not treat internal implementation details as requirements

4. **Classify drift findings** — compare the repository evidence to the current
   specs and sort findings into:
   - confirmed behavior that exists in code but is missing from specs
   - existing requirements that appear outdated or incomplete
   - ambiguous findings that need human confirmation before they become specs
   - areas with no meaningful drift in the scanned scope

5. **Report drift summary in chat** — present a concise summary covering:
   - the scan scope that was analyzed
   - confirmed gaps or outdated spec areas, with specific file references
   - ambiguous findings that need human input
   - areas in scope where no meaningful drift was found

6. **Get user confirmation** — before editing any spec file, ask the user to
   confirm the proposed changes. List each spec file that will be added,
   modified, or removed. Do not proceed until the user explicitly approves.

7. **Edit spec files directly** — for each confirmed gap:
   - edit the corresponding file under `.spec-driven/specs/`
   - add, modify, or remove `### Requirement:` blocks as appropriate
   - preserve or update `mapping.implementation` and `mapping.tests`
     frontmatter to match the repository evidence used for the sync
   - describe observable behavior only
   - if no existing category or file fits, create the new file under
     `.spec-driven/specs/` with the correct relative path

8. **Refresh INDEX.md** — after all spec edits are complete, run:
   ```
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js init
   ```
   This regenerates `.spec-driven/specs/INDEX.md` to reflect the current
   file state.

   If mapping frontmatter changed, also run:
   ```
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify-spec-mappings
   ```

9. **Report final changes** — summarize what was done:
   - which spec files were added, modified, or removed
   - a brief description of the drift that was fixed in each file
   - any ambiguous findings that were left unresolved and why

## Rules

- This is a documentation skill only — do not change product code
- Read spec context before judging drift
- Respect the user-selected scope; do not imply full-repository coverage after a
  scoped scan
- Use code, tests, and nearby docs as evidence, but write only observable
  behavior into the specs
- Do not create a change — edit `.spec-driven/specs/` files directly
- Do not write a standalone report file; the summary belongs in chat
- Get explicit user confirmation before editing any spec file
- Keep implementation and test mappings in frontmatter, not in requirement
