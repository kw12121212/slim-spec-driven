You are helping the user initialize the spec-driven workflow in a project.

## Prerequisites

The target project directory must be accessible from the current environment.
Before proceeding, verify the path you plan to initialize exists and is the
intended project root.

## Steps

1. **Confirm the target project** — ask which project to initialize. If the user is already in the project root, use the current directory. Accept either `.` or an explicit path.

2. **Run init** — run:
   ```
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js init [path]
   ```
   Pass the path only if it differs from the current directory.
   - If `.spec-driven/` does not exist, this bootstraps it from scratch
   - If `.spec-driven/` already exists, this repairs any missing scaffold files and regenerates `specs/INDEX.md` without overwriting existing files

3. **Draft context** — read any existing project files that describe the project (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `package.json`, `pom.xml`, etc.). Draft a `context` value of 3–5 sentences covering:
   - What the project does
   - Tech stack and language(s)
   - Key conventions or constraints worth noting

   Write the draft into the `context` field of `.spec-driven/config.yaml`, then show it to the user and ask if they want to adjust anything.

4. **Capture existing behavior** — ask: "Does this project already have behavior worth documenting?" If yes, help the user write initial spec files under `.spec-driven/specs/<category>/` using the standard format:
   - Group by domain area (e.g. `auth/`, `api/`, `core/`)
   - Use `### Requirement: <name>` headings with RFC 2119 keywords
   - Describe what the system currently does, not what it should do
   - Add an entry for each new file to `.spec-driven/specs/INDEX.md`

   This step is important for existing projects — without initial specs, `propose` has nothing to read and cannot detect conflicts.

5. **Confirm** — show the user what was created and suggest running `/spec-driven-propose` to create their first change.

## Rules
- Do not create any changes — initialization only
- Keep the context field concise: 3–5 sentences is enough for the AI to work from
- If `.spec-driven/` already exists, do not overwrite existing files — repair missing scaffold files only
