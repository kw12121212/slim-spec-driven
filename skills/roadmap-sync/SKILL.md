You are helping the user synchronize `.spec-driven/roadmap/` with the current
change history.

## This Skill's Commands

If you cannot remember the exact command used by this skill, look it up here
before running anything. Do not guess.

```yaml
init: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js init
roadmap-status: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js roadmap-status
verify-roadmap: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify-roadmap
```

## Prerequisites

The `.spec-driven/` directory must exist at the **project root**. Before
proceeding, verify:
```
ls .spec-driven/
```
If this fails, the project is not initialized. Run `/spec-driven-init` first.

If `.spec-driven/roadmap/` is missing, repair the scaffold first:
```
node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js init
```

## Steps

1. **Read roadmap state first** — before changing anything, read:
   - `.spec-driven/config.yaml`
   - `.spec-driven/roadmap/INDEX.md`
   - every milestone file listed in the roadmap index
   - run `node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js roadmap-status`
   - inspect the returned milestone and planned change state summary

2. **Compare roadmap to repository reality** — use the `roadmap-status` output
   as the source of deterministic comparison. For each milestone in scope,
   identify:
   - planned changes that are archived
   - planned changes that still exist as active work
   - planned changes that are missing or renamed
   - milestone statuses that no longer match the derived status
   - any ambiguity the script cannot resolve, such as likely renames or roadmap
     prose that still needs human judgment

3. **Update roadmap files** — reconcile milestone status and each listed planned
   change's declared status based on the repository evidence you found.

   Use only these legal declared status values while interpreting or rewriting
   roadmap files:
   - milestone status: `proposed`, `active`, `blocked`, `complete`
   - planned change status: `planned`, `complete`

4. **Preserve roadmap rules** — during sync:
   - do not mark a milestone complete unless every listed planned change is
     archived
   - keep the roadmap as planning state, not an implementation log

5. **Validate roadmap size before finish** — run:
   ```
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify-roadmap
   ```
   If validation reports that any milestone is too large, stop and tell the user
   to split it instead of presenting roadmap sync as complete.

6. **Report the sync result** — summarize:
   - milestones updated
   - planned changes whose state changed
   - missing or ambiguous references that still need human cleanup

## Rules

- This is a planning/documentation skill only — do not change product code
- Use `roadmap-status` plus roadmap files as the source of truth for deterministic status comparison
- Do not preserve stale manual labels that conflict with actual archive state
- Surface ambiguity explicitly when a roadmap entry no longer matches any change
