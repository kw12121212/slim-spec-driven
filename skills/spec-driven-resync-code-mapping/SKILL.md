You are helping the user retrofit or repair spec-code mapping frontmatter in
`.spec-driven/specs/` files.

## This Skill's Commands

If you cannot remember the exact command used by this skill, look it up here
before running anything. Do not guess.

```yaml
verify-spec-mappings: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify-spec-mappings
audit-spec-mapping-coverage: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js audit-spec-mapping-coverage <spec-path> [--implementation <repo-path> ...] [--tests <repo-path> ...]
audit-unmapped-spec-evidence: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js audit-unmapped-spec-evidence [--implementation <repo-path> ...] [--tests <repo-path> ...]
```

## Prerequisites

The `.spec-driven/` directory must exist at the **project root**. Before
proceeding, verify:
```
ls .spec-driven/
```
If this fails, the project is not initialized. Run `/spec-driven-init` first.

## Steps

1. **Choose the remapping scope** — determine whether the user wants to remap:
   - all main spec files
   - one spec category or file
   - only specs reported by `verify-spec-mappings` as malformed or stale

   If the user already gave a scope, use it. If not, ask which scope to repair.

2. **Read spec context first** — before proposing mapping edits, read:
   - `.spec-driven/config.yaml`
   - `.spec-driven/specs/INDEX.md`
   - every main spec file in the selected scope
   - any existing mapping frontmatter in those spec files

3. **Run mapping validation** — run:
   ```
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify-spec-mappings
   ```
   Use the JSON result to identify missing frontmatter, malformed mapping
   fields, non-string entries, and missing mapped files.

4. **Inspect repository evidence** — infer mappings by converging on the current
   repository evidence, not by trying to list every related file. Keep
   implementation files separate from test files.

   - Derive search terms from the spec path, filename, requirement titles,
     scenario titles, and distinctive command names, skill names, config keys,
     or domain terms in the spec body.
   - Search likely implementation and test locations for exact terms first, then
     obvious variants such as `kebab-case`, `snake_case`, `camelCase`, and
     singular/plural forms.
   - Keep files that directly implement, expose, validate, or verify the
     behavior. Exclude generic helpers unless the behavior is primarily
     implemented there or the entrypoint would otherwise be misleading without
     it.
   - Follow at most one level of structural evidence when needed: imports,
     exports, command registries, dispatch tables, and tests that directly
     execute or assert the behavior.
   - `mapping.implementation` should contain primary implementation files,
     feature entrypoints, and thin orchestrators that materially wire the
     behavior together.
   - `mapping.tests` should contain tests that directly verify the behavior.
   - If behavior spans multiple primary files, include all of them. If evidence
     is weak or conflicting, keep the smaller confident set and report the
     ambiguity.
   - Stop once the mapping covers the main files a maintainer would inspect
     first. Do not chase every transitive helper.
   - For framework or meta-specs, start with files named directly in the spec,
     then add workflow artifacts that define or enforce the behavior, such as
     relevant `skills/*/SKILL.md`, `scripts/spec-driven.ts`, `install.sh`, test
     files, and top-level docs.
   - Use repo structure as evidence: installation specs map to installer code,
     installation tests, and shipped skills; mapping-validation specs map to
     validator code, spec-format docs, and validator tests.
   - Treat the mapping as complete when each requirement is covered by at least
     one primary implementation file and one test or verification path where
     such evidence exists.
   - If a requirement still has no confident mapping, mark it ambiguous and ask
     the user instead of inventing coverage.

5. **Classify findings** — sort findings into:
   - missing mapping frontmatter that can be confidently added
   - malformed mapping frontmatter that can be repaired without changing
     requirement behavior
   - stale paths that can be replaced with current implementation or test files
   - behavior/spec drift that requires `/spec-driven-sync-specs`,
     `/spec-driven-spec-edit`, or a normal change workflow
   - ambiguous mappings that require human input

   For each target spec with a confident candidate mapping, run:
   ```
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js audit-spec-mapping-coverage <spec-path> [--implementation <repo-path> ...] [--tests <repo-path> ...]
   ```
   Use the candidate implementation and test sets as the explicit evidence
   inputs. Use the `node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js audit-spec-mapping-coverage ...`
   output to identify missing and extra mapping entries before presenting the
   edit.

   Also run:
   ```
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js audit-unmapped-spec-evidence [--implementation <repo-path> ...] [--tests <repo-path> ...]
   ```
   Use the same candidate evidence set to check whether some files are not
   mapped by any main spec at all. If that happens, decide whether the likely
   next step is mapping repair for another spec, spec synchronization, direct
   spec editing, or a normal change workflow.

6. **Present proposed mapping edits** — before editing any file, show the user:
   - each spec file whose frontmatter will change
   - the proposed `mapping.implementation` paths
   - the proposed `mapping.tests` paths
   - any behavior/spec drift or ambiguous mapping that will not be edited by
     this skill

   Wait for explicit confirmation before writing files.

7. **Apply confirmed mapping repairs** — after confirmation, edit only mapping
   frontmatter in the selected main spec files. Do not change implementation
   files. Do not rewrite requirement bodies unless the user switches to
   `/spec-driven-sync-specs`, `/spec-driven-spec-edit`, or a normal change
   workflow.

8. **Validate after editing** — rerun:
   ```
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify-spec-mappings
   ```
   Fix safe frontmatter format issues immediately and rerun
   `node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify-spec-mappings`. If any
   remaining error needs human judgment, report it clearly.

9. **Report final result** — summarize:
   - which spec files had mapping frontmatter added or repaired
   - which stale paths were replaced
   - whether mapping validation now passes
   - any behavior/spec drift or ambiguity left for another workflow

## Rules

- This is a planning/documentation skill only — do not change implementation
  code or tests
- Do not create, modify, archive, or cancel entries under `.spec-driven/changes/`
- Do not rewrite requirement behavior while repairing mappings
- Keep `mapping.implementation` and `mapping.tests` separate
- Use repo-relative file paths only
- Keep mappings at file granularity; do not use line numbers, ranges, or symbols
- Always run `node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify-spec-mappings`
  before and after confirmed edits
- Get explicit user confirmation before editing any spec file
- If mapping repair reveals behavior/spec drift, recommend the appropriate
  spec synchronization or change workflow instead of silently changing
  requirements
