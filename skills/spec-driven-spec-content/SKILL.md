description: Route spec content into the correct delta spec file. Reads .spec-driven/specs/INDEX.md first, then decides whether to update an existing spec file, create a new spec file, create a new category, modify requirements, or remove specific requirements.

You are helping the user place spec content into the correct delta spec file for
an existing spec-driven change.

## Prerequisites

The `.spec-driven/` directory must exist at the **project root**. Before
proceeding, verify:
```
ls .spec-driven/
```
If this fails, the project is not initialized. Run `/spec-driven-init` first.

## Steps

1. **Select the change** — run `node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js modify`
   to list active changes. Ask which change to edit if the user did not specify
   one.

2. **Understand the request** — identify whether the user wants to:
   - add new spec content
   - extend an existing spec
   - modify an existing requirement
   - remove one or more existing requirements

3. **Read index-first context** — before deciding any path, read:
   - `.spec-driven/config.yaml`
   - `.spec-driven/specs/INDEX.md`
   - any existing files under `.spec-driven/changes/<name>/specs/` that already
     look related

4. **Choose candidate targets from `INDEX.md`** — use the index to determine
   which existing categories and spec files might already cover the requested
   behavior.
   - If one or more candidates exist, read the full main spec files before making
     any routing decision
   - Only create a new category if no existing category fits the behavior
   - Only create a new spec file inside an existing category if the behavior does
     not fit any existing file in that category

5. **Decide the delta spec path** — classify the request into exactly one of:
   - update an existing delta file that mirrors an existing main spec file
   - create a new delta file under an existing category
   - create a new delta file under a new category
   - revise existing requirements in a delta file that already exists

   Keep the delta path aligned with the main spec path that should exist after
   archive.
   - If the chosen delta spec file already exists under
     `.spec-driven/changes/<name>/specs/`, read that exact file before appending
     or revising content

6. **Edit the delta spec content** — preserve the standard delta format:
   - Use `## ADDED Requirements` for new requirements
   - Use `## MODIFIED Requirements` for changed requirements, including a
     `Previously:` note
   - Use `## REMOVED Requirements` for deletions, including the reason
   - Keep `### Requirement:` headings intact
   - Describe observable behavior, not implementation details

7. **Handle removals explicitly** — if the request removes spec content:
   - identify the exact `### Requirement:` heading or headings being removed
   - write those removals explicitly in the delta file
   - do not use vague phrasing like "remove old spec" or "delete obsolete content"
   - if the target requirement is ambiguous after reading the relevant specs, stop
     and ask the user which requirement should be removed

8. **Run the final spec format check** — after any spec edit, run:
   ```
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify <name>
   ```
   - Treat missing artifacts, malformed delta section markers/headings, and other
     spec structure problems as the format issues to repair
   - Fix any safe format issues immediately and rerun `verify`
   - If `verify` reports only non-format workflow blockers such as open questions
     in `questions.md`, surface those separately instead of misreporting them as
     spec-format failures
   - Do not finish without this check
   - If unresolved format or structure errors remain, report them clearly to the
     user

9. **Summarize the routing decision** — tell the user:
   - which category/file was chosen
   - whether it was an existing file, new file, or new category
   - whether the change added, modified, or removed requirements
   - whether the final format check passed

## Rules

- Read `.spec-driven/specs/INDEX.md` before choosing a category or file name
- Prefer existing categories and files unless the content clearly requires a new path
- Read the relevant main specs before editing delta specs
- If the chosen delta file already exists, read that exact file before editing it
- Do not implement code — this skill edits planning artifacts only
- Always finish with a spec format check
