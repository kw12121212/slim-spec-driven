You are helping the user create or restructure the repository roadmap.

## This Skill's Commands

If you cannot remember the exact command used by this skill, look it up here
before running anything. Do not guess.

```yaml
init: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js init
verify-roadmap: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify-roadmap
```

## Prerequisites

The `.spec-driven/` directory must exist at the **project root**. Before
proceeding, verify:
```
ls .spec-driven/
```
If this fails, the project is not initialized. Run `/spec-driven-init` first.

If `.spec-driven/roadmap/` is missing, repair the scaffold first:
```
node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js init
```

## Steps

1. **Read roadmap context first** — before proposing milestone structure, read:
   - `.spec-driven/config.yaml`
   - `.spec-driven/roadmap/INDEX.md` if it exists
   - every existing file under `.spec-driven/roadmap/milestones/`
   - `.spec-driven/specs/INDEX.md` and any main spec files that are clearly
     relevant to the user's planning scope
   - active and archived changes under `.spec-driven/changes/` as evidence of
     what is already in progress or complete

   You MAY delegate bounded analysis-only work such as roadmap summarization,
   candidate milestone comparisons, or likely spec-path discovery to a
   sub-agent. The parent agent MUST keep user confirmation, roadmap shape
   selection, and final `.spec-driven/roadmap/` writes.

2. **Understand the planning goal** — determine:
   - whether the user wants to create a brand-new roadmap or restructure an
     existing one
   - what major phases or stage goals the roadmap should express
   - whether there are existing changes that already belong to specific
     milestones
   - whether any existing milestone files are still using a legacy structure,
     such as an extra `## Candidate Ideas` section, a combined
     `## Dependencies / Risks` section, or missing `## In Scope`,
     `## Out of Scope`, or `## Notes` sections

3. **Converge on milestone boundaries before writing** — help the user settle:
     - milestone names and ordering
     - each milestone's goal and done criteria
     - which concrete `Planned Changes` belong in each milestone
     - key dependencies, risks, and sequencing
     - any non-obvious legacy-migration interpretation needed to rewrite older
       milestone files into the canonical format

4. **Confirm the roadmap shape** — before editing files, summarize the intended
   milestone structure and ask for explicit confirmation.
   If legacy milestone migration is in scope, include any non-obvious content
   reinterpretation you plan to make while converting older milestone files.

5. **Write roadmap assets** — update:
    - `.spec-driven/roadmap/INDEX.md`
    - `.spec-driven/roadmap/milestones/<milestone>.md` for each milestone in scope
    When a milestone is in a legacy format, rewrite it into the canonical
    section set while preserving clearly recoverable meaning. Use the legacy
    milestone wording itself as migration evidence.

6. **Preserve roadmap rules** — in every milestone file:
    - use these standard section headings:
      - `## Goal`
      - `## In Scope`
      - `## Out of Scope`
      - `## Done Criteria`
      - `## Planned Changes`
      - `## Dependencies`
      - `## Risks`
      - `## Status`
      - `## Notes`
    - milestone declared statuses are limited to:
      - `proposed`
      - `active`
      - `blocked`
      - `complete`
    - write each `Planned Changes` item with a canonical first line,
      `- \`<change-name>\` - Declared: <status> - <summary>`
    - planned change declared statuses are limited to:
      - `planned`
      - `complete`
    - keep each planned change description on that same line; do not add
      indented continuation lines below the bullet
    - default new or unfinished planned changes to `Declared: planned`
    - put extra milestone-local context in another section such as `## Notes`
      instead of attaching multiline detail under `## Planned Changes`
    - treat `Planned Changes` as the milestone's only work list and keep it
      limited to concrete approved change work
    - derive milestone completion from archived planned changes rather than
      manual toggles
    - when migrating a legacy milestone, map content conservatively:
      - move clearly approved executable work into `## Planned Changes`
      - split a combined `## Dependencies / Risks` section only when the source
        distinction is clear enough to preserve confidently
      - infer `## In Scope` or `## Out of Scope` only when the old milestone
        wording makes those boundaries clear
      - preserve useful leftover context in `## Notes` instead of dropping it
      - surface ambiguity to the user instead of silently inventing an exact
        migration

7. **Validate roadmap size before finish** — run:
   ```
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify-roadmap
   ```
   - If validation reports a milestone is too large, stop and tell the user to
     split it into smaller milestones
   - Do not present the roadmap as ready while size validation fails

8. **Summarize the result** — report the milestone structure created or changed,
   what planned work was assigned to each milestone, and any remaining planning
   gaps.

## Rules

- This is a planning/documentation skill only — do not change product code
- Read roadmap files and relevant change history before restructuring anything
- Do not collapse multiple milestones into one oversized roadmap document
- Do not mark a milestone complete manually if its planned changes are not all
  archived
- Do not let a sub-agent own the confirmation step or final roadmap file edits
