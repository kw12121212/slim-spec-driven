You are helping the user verify a spec-driven change before archiving.

## This Skill's Commands

If you cannot remember the exact command used by this skill, look it up here
before running anything. Do not guess.

```yaml
modify: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js modify
verify: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify <name>
verify-spec-mappings: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify-spec-mappings
apply: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js apply <name>
audit-spec-mapping-coverage: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js audit-spec-mapping-coverage <spec-path> [--implementation <repo-path> ...] [--tests <repo-path> ...]
audit-unmapped-spec-evidence: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js audit-unmapped-spec-evidence [--implementation <repo-path> ...] [--tests <repo-path> ...]
```

## Prerequisites

The `.spec-driven/` directory must exist at the **project root**. Before proceeding, verify:
```
ls .spec-driven/
```
If this fails, the project is not initialized. Run `/spec-driven-init` first.

## Steps

1. **Select the change** — run `node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js modify` to list active changes. Ask which change to verify. If already specified, use it.

2. **Format check** — run:
   ```
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify <name>
   ```
    Report any errors (blocking) or warnings (non-blocking).
    - Treat any testing-readiness error from the script as CRITICAL, including
      missing `## Testing`, missing lint/validation coverage, missing unit test
      coverage, or required testing tasks with no explicit runnable command.

   Also run:
   ```
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify-spec-mappings
   ```
   Treat malformed spec mapping frontmatter, missing mapping fields, or missing
   mapped files as CRITICAL findings for affected main specs.

3. **Task completion check** — run:
   ```
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js apply <name>
   ```
   If `remaining > 0`, list the incomplete tasks. These are CRITICAL issues.

4. **Open questions check** — read `.spec-driven/changes/<name>/questions.md` and scan for `- [ ] Q:` entries:
     - Any open question is CRITICAL
     - The script also reports these as errors; treat them as CRITICAL here

5. **Implementation evidence check** — for each completed task in tasks.md:
     - Identify what code or files the task should have changed
     - Verify the change actually exists (read relevant files)
     - If a completed task claims implementation, test, or spec work and there is
       no visible evidence, treat that as CRITICAL unless the ambiguity is
       clearly documented in `questions.md`

6. **Build a mapping evidence set** — before judging mapping quality, build a
   change-local evidence set from:
   - each touched delta spec file under `.spec-driven/changes/<name>/specs/`
   - implementation files actually changed for the completed behavior
   - test files actually changed for the completed behavior
   - files explicitly relied on to provide or directly verify the completed behavior

   Prefer the smallest confident evidence set. Do not infer semantic coverage
   from distant helpers when the main implementation or direct test files are clear.

   For each touched delta spec file, run:
   ```
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js audit-spec-mapping-coverage <spec-path> [--implementation <repo-path> ...] [--tests <repo-path> ...]
   ```
   Use the evidence set you built as the explicit `--implementation` and `--tests` inputs.

   Also run:
   ```
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js audit-unmapped-spec-evidence [--implementation <repo-path> ...] [--tests <repo-path> ...]
   ```
   Use the same evidence set to identify implementation or test files that are
   not mapped by any main spec.

7. **Spec alignment check** — read `.spec-driven/specs/`, `.spec-driven/config.yaml`, `.spec-driven/changes/<name>/proposal.md`, and all files in `.spec-driven/changes/<name>/specs/`:
     - Does the implementation match what was proposed?
     - Do the delta files in `changes/<name>/specs/` accurately describe what was implemented? Empty `specs/` with real behavior changes is a CRITICAL.
     - Does each delta file mirror its corresponding main spec file path? Mismatched paths mean the merge will fail.
     - Do the delta files use the standard format (`### Requirement: <name>`, RFC 2119 keywords, `#### Scenario:` blocks)? Non-conforming format is a CRITICAL — the spec format is mandatory.
     - For each touched delta spec file, compare `mapping.implementation` and
       `mapping.tests` against the change-local evidence set using the audit
       output from `node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js audit-spec-mapping-coverage <spec-path> [--implementation <repo-path> ...] [--tests <repo-path> ...]`.
     - If the evidence clearly shows that a touched spec depends on an
       implementation file or directly verifying test file missing from the
       mapping, report that omission as CRITICAL.
     - If the evidence is ambiguous, prefer the smaller confident set and report
       the ambiguity instead of inventing semantic coverage.
     - Report repo-wide structural mapping errors from `verify-spec-mappings`
       separately from change-local mapping omissions using the result from
       `node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js verify-spec-mappings`.
     - If the unmapped-evidence audit shows that a primary implementation file
       or directly verifying test file from this change is not mapped by any
       main spec, report that as CRITICAL when the gap leaves this change's spec
       coverage incomplete.
     - If the unmapped-evidence audit only finds files outside this change scope
       or weakly related candidates, report them separately as REPO DEBT or
       lower-confidence WARNINGs.
     - If config.yaml has a `rules` field (including any `fileMatch` entries), check whether the implementation and artifacts comply — violations are WARNINGs
     - If proposal.md has an **Unchanged Behavior** section with content, verify the implementation has not violated any listed behaviors — violations are CRITICALs
     - Flag misalignments as WARNINGs or CRITICALs

8. **Output a tiered report**:
    ```
    CRITICAL (blocks archive):
      - [list or "none"]

    REPO DEBT (outside this change):
      - [list or "none"]

    WARNING (should address):
      - [list or "none"]

    SUGGESTION (optional improvements):
      - [list or "none"]
    ```

9. **Recommend next step**:
    - If CRITICAL issues: address them before archiving
    - If only WARNINGs: ask user if they want to address them or proceed
    - If clean: suggest `/spec-driven-review <name>`

## Rules
- Be honest — don't pass a change just because tasks are checked off
- CRITICALs are things that would make the change incorrect or incomplete
- REPO DEBT is pre-existing repository state outside the change scope; report it
  clearly and separately from change-local findings
- WARNINGs are things that reduce confidence but don't necessarily block
- SUGGESTIONs are optional quality improvements
- Keep implementation and test mappings in frontmatter, not in requirement
