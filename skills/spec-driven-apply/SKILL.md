You are helping the user implement a spec-driven change.

## This Skill's Commands

If you cannot remember the exact command used by this skill, look it up here
before running anything. Do not guess.

```yaml
modify: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js modify
apply: node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js apply <name>
```

## Prerequisites

The `.spec-driven/` directory must exist at the **project root**. Before proceeding, verify:
```
ls .spec-driven/
```
If this fails, the project is not initialized. Run `/spec-driven-init` first.

## Steps

1. **Select the change** — run `node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js modify` to list active changes. Ask which change to apply. If already specified, use it.

2. **Load context** — read all artifacts:
   - You MUST treat all prior conversational context as stale, unreliable, and non-authoritative.
   - You MUST NOT use prior chat context as a source of truth for requirements, task state, implementation details, or completion status.
   - You MUST rebuild working context from the current change artifacts, relevant base specs, and the current repository state before taking any implementation action.
   - If prior chat context differs from the files or repository state in any way, you MUST discard the prior chat context and follow the files and repository state only.
   - Do not use prior chat context unless it has been explicitly re-validated against the current files and repository state.
   - `.spec-driven/changes/<name>/proposal.md` — what and why; note the **Unchanged Behavior** section — these behaviors must not be broken during implementation
   - `.spec-driven/changes/<name>/specs/` — delta spec files (mirror of main specs/ structure)
   - `.spec-driven/changes/<name>/design.md` — approach and decisions
   - `.spec-driven/changes/<name>/tasks.md` — the checklist
   - `.spec-driven/changes/<name>/questions.md` — open and resolved questions
   Also read:
   - `.spec-driven/config.yaml` — project context; treat `rules` as binding constraints; if `fileMatch` entries are present, apply matching rules when editing files whose paths match the glob pattern
   - `.spec-driven/specs/INDEX.md` — identifies all existing spec files
   - Every spec file in INDEX.md that is relevant to this change — read full content to understand current requirements before writing code
   - Mapping frontmatter in relevant main and delta spec files; use
     `mapping.implementation` and `mapping.tests` as starting context for files
     to inspect

3. **Check task status** — run:
   ```
   node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js apply <name>
   ```
   Show the user the task summary (total, complete, remaining).

4. **Gate on open questions** — read `questions.md` and scan for `- [ ] Q:` entries:
   - If any open questions are found, list each one and **stop** before implementation
   - For each open question, present a structured user-facing block with:
     - `Question`
     - `Explanation`
     - `Impact`
     - `Recommendation`
   - `Explanation` must clarify why the question is still unresolved after reading the change artifacts, relevant main specs, and current repository state
   - `Impact` must describe what implementation choice, task, behavior, or unchanged-behavior guarantee depends on the answer
   - `Recommendation` may suggest a preferred answer, but only as a suggestion
   - Do not implement tasks, edit implementation files, or mark the question resolved until the user explicitly answers or confirms the decision
   - Only continue once all questions are resolved in `questions.md` under `## Resolved` with an `A:` answer

5. **Implement tasks** — work through each `- [ ]` task in order:
   - Read relevant code before making changes
   - Implement the task
   - Verify the change does not violate any **Unchanged Behavior** listed in proposal.md
   - For `## Testing` tasks: actually run the tests (lint, unit tests) and confirm they pass before marking complete
   - Mark it complete in tasks.md by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]`
   - Briefly confirm what was done before moving to the next task

6. **Update delta specs** — after all tasks are done, re-read each file in `changes/<name>/specs/` and verify it accurately reflects what was actually implemented:
   - If the implementation diverged from the original plan, update the affected files
   - If additional spec files need to be created or modified, do so now
   - Update delta spec mapping frontmatter so `mapping.implementation` and
     `mapping.tests` list the actual implementation and test files changed or
     relied on

7. **On completion** — when all tasks are done and delta spec is accurate:
   - Run `node {{SKILL_DIR}}/scripts/spec-driven.js apply <name>` again to confirm 0 remaining
   - Suggest running `/spec-driven-verify <name>` to verify the implementation

## Rules
- Read existing code before modifying it
- Complete tasks in order unless there is a clear dependency reason to skip
- Mark tasks complete immediately after implementing them, not in bulk at the end
- If a task is ambiguous, read proposal.md and design.md before asking the user
- Do not implement tasks that are already marked `- [x]`
- Open questions require explicit user resolution before implementation starts
- Recommendations do not count as resolved answers until the user confirms them
- Keep implementation and test mappings in frontmatter, not in requirement
